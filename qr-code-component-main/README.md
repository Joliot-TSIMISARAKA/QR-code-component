## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

-Center a single element within a body

```css
body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm not really familiar with flexbox yet, I've already struggled a bit, centering the card in the middle of the page
So I'm looking forward to another project that will make use of flexbox and grid so that I can be more comfortable using them
